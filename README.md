# botnet_passwords
This is a raw list of passwords used by a botnet that is trying to gain access to my honeypot. Username is always the domain name or "admin" or "administrator".  This list was collected over the last 3 days.  Duplicates are included to show frequency.

You should always use strong passwords, but also never ever use any of these to secure anything.
